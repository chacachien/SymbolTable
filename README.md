 # DSA C++ Implementation Repository

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) commonly used in computer science at HCMUT. 

## Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

- **ass1_LinkedList**: Contains implementations related to **linked lists**.

- **ass2_splayTree**: Contains implementations related to **splay trees**.

- **ass3_hashTable**: Contains implementations related to **hash tables**.



## Usage

Each folder contains individual implementations of data structures. You can explore the respective `.cpp` files to see the code and understand their functionalities. Feel free to modify or adapt the code for your own DSA learning or projects.

##  Structure and Implementations

Each folder contains a `.cpp` file demonstrating the implementation of a particular data structure, along with possible helper functions and test cases. 

For example, in `ass1_LinkedList`, the `DoublyLinkedList.cpp` file implements a doubly linked list structure with functions for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other common linked list operations.
